Analyzed and visualized COVID-19 data for Pakistan using R, focusing on regional impact, case distribution, and predictive modeling to forecast deaths and recoveries. Developed insights to support targeted interventions and resource allocation.

COVID-19 Cases in Pakistan

This project analyzes COVID-19 data for various cities within Pakistani provinces from February 26, 2020, to April 19, 2020. The dataset includes information on total cases, deaths, and recoveries. The main objectives are to understand the regional impact, identify high-risk areas, and assess control measures' effectiveness. The project involves data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling using linear regression to forecast deaths and recoveries. The results provide insights into the distribution and severity of the pandemic, aiding in targeted interventions and resource allocation.
